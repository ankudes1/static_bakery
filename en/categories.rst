Tutorials
---------

Share your knowledge of CakePHP with the rest of the community. No doubt, everyone will be very grateful. Every developer should feel comfortable adding a tutorial.

Components
----------

Components are use to aid and assist controllers in performing their business logic. They extend Object and do not have direct access to the model. Typical usage is in Authentication, Filtering, and Rendering controls. Examples: EmailComponent, AuthComponent, ImageComponent.

Helpers
-------

Helpers extend the functionality of the view and enable you to keep the templates clean. In the class you can place some display logic or organize some view specific code. Examples include AjaxHelper, TreeHelper, FormHelper.

Models
------

Models allow interaction with a datasource. A datasource can be a database, an xml document, or the file system. The Model typically performs the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the data.

Plugins
-------

Plugins are mini-applications, but are easier to distribute and just drop into the main application. They extend the functionality of the application by providing a self-contained MVC for a specific part of your application. Examples could include a Gallery, a Blog, or a Forum.

Snippets
--------

Every once in a while we stumble upon great little pieces of code that can make our lives easier. These pieces might be helper methods, AppController methods, AppModel methods, etc. Share your tasty morsels of PHP code.

Behaviors
---------

Behaviors help the Model handle data. Examples include List, Tree, etc.
