Twitter Bootstrap Plugin for CakePHP
====================================

by %s on October 11, 2012

Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is a powerful
front-end framework. I'd really love to use this for several projects
and pages. Now I have created a simple plugin to use the power of
Twitter Bootstrap easier inside CakePHP.

With Twitter Bootstrap you get a fast and powerful front-end framework
that makes it easier to design pretty cool websites. In my eyes this
is a must for every web-designer and developer.

My plugin can be found on GitHub under
`https://github.com/visionred/BootstrapCake`_

It comes across with a easy shell for loading the framework files,
creating compatible layouts and a strong view helper. A documentation
is also available.

So just take a look at it and enjoy the power of Twitter Bootstrap.

If you have any questions, ideas or bugs send me a message or report
an issue on GitHub.

Cheers, Florian Nitschmann
