That's all !


Usage
~~~~~


In the controller
`````````````````

Then to use it in your controller, you can do :

Like an item

::

    $this->Post->like($post_id, $this->Auth->user('id'));


Dislike an item

::

    $this->Post->dislike($post_id, $this->Auth->user('id'));


Find all items liked by an user

::

    $this->Post->findLikedBy($this->Auth->user('id'));


Test if an user like an item

::

    if($this->Post->isLikedBy($post_id, $this->Auth->user('id'))){...}


Find the most liked item

::

    $this->Post->find('most_liked', array('limit'=>5));



In the view
```````````

Add the helper in your controller :

::

    
        public PostController extends AppController{
            public $helpers = array('Like.Like');
        }


And, in your view:

::

    
        $this->Like->like('post', $post_id);
        $this->Like->dislike('post', $post_id);
