Breadcrumbs trail for unordered pages
=====================================

by %s on April 23, 2012

The Idea is to create a trail of visited pages, allowing you to always
jump back and to alway see last visited pages. This can be helpful if
breadcrumbs can not be used, since there is no clean hierachical
structure with parent/child defined. Furthermore, this Component /
Helper is only included once for the appController itself and once in
your layout. No need to manually add the code to each and every page.

I also played with $referer variable, back button usage and javascript
back-functions but in the end the trac was always getting kind of
mixed up by functions / methods like save, edit, etc. This
Component/Helper pack will allow you to customize methods and
controllers to be ignored and to display a nice, clickable trail in
the form of

Component ( index ) > Component ( view) > Component2 ( index ) >

This bundle consists of a Component - which may be called from
appController itself only once or from each controller by itself - and
of a Helper, which is called within your view or in the layout
directly. If called from the Layout, make sure to add the Helper to
your app_controller as described in step 3 of the Installation how to.

     * Purpose
     * ---------
     * Track your way and allow Backwards movement. 
     * The Idea is to create a trail of visited pages, allowing you always jump back.
     * This can help if a breadcrumb logical can not be used, since there is no clean hierachical structure 
     * with parent/child structure
     * I also played with referer variable, back button usage and javascript back but in the end the trac was 
     * always getting messed by functions / methods like save, edit, etc.
     * 
     * This Component/Helper pack will allow you to customize methods and controllers to be ignored and to 
     * display a nice, linked trail in the form of
     * Component ( index ) > Component ( view) > Component2 ( index ) >
     *
     *
     * What does it constis of
     * -------------------------
     * 1. NavigationComponent ( this file ) 
     *    The component constists of 4 Functions:
     *    - process: The main function to be called from appController: Stores current page, 
     *                                                                                                                                    handles clicks on links, 
     *                                                                                                                                    keeps trail short
     *    - storeTrail : Stroes current trail to session ussing $sessionVarName
     *        - walkBack   : If a Link was clicked in our trail, remove all visited pages behind this link
     *                                 This only happens for links passing $navpointUrl and the index.
     *                                     See corresponding NavigationHelper to created correct links 
     *    - shrinkTrail: Shift trail until it's length reaches $maxItems or the given length
     *    - cleanTrail: Call this on logout in order to remove trail variable
     *
     * 2. NavigationHelper
     *         Meant to create correct Links to jump back in time. These links also include the index in our trail
     *    and therefor the trail will be adjusted after clicking such a link.
     *
     *
     * Installation
     * ----------------
     *
     * 1. Add Component to app/controllers/components/
     * 2. Add Helper to app/views/helpers/
     * 3. Add Helper to AppController ( nessecary to use in layout) in app/app_controller.php:
     *
     *           var $helpers = array(...       , 'Navigation');
     *             --> If $helpers was not defined yet, you will have to add all used helpers like 'Html' etc.
     *
     * 4. Call 'process' in app_controller.php directly at the beginning of beforeFilter and set variable
     *
     *             $this->Navigation->Process( $this );
     *            $this->set('trail', $this->Navigation->trail );
     * 
     * 5. In your Layout or in your desired View, call the trail creator or only read the link:
     *
     *            $this->Navigation->printBacklinks( $trail, 8 )
     *            or
     *            echo $this->Html->link("Back", $this->Navigation->getBacklinkForView( $trail ) );
     *
     * 6. Possibly you want to enclose 'printBacklinks' into a div and adjust its hover and look.
     *    i.e.  
     *    <div class='crumb'>$this->Navigation->printBacklinks( $trail, 8 )</div>
     *    and
     *    .crumbs {    color: #999; }
     *        .crumbs a { color: #aaa;    font: 0.9em arial; }
     *    .crumbs a:hover { font-size: 1em; color: #000; font-weight: bold; }
     *
     *
