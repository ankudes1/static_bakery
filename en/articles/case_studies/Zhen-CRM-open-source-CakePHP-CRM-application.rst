A simple CRM built on CakePHP 2.x

We are pleased to announce the release of Zhen CRM, an open source CRM
solution built on CakePHP.

While this does not have the complicated features of enterprise CRMs,
it has the basic features that most small businesses could use - such
as contacts, tasks, "deals" and a calendar.

In contrast to the many other commercial CRM solutions available on
the market, this is free, simple and can be installed on one's own
servers or shared hosts.
