Code Authors, Please mention the CakePHP version!
=================================================

by %s on October 22, 2011

Currently, we have four versions of CakePHP. I think that it is very
important and time saving for developers to mention the target version
of code supplied by an author.

In other word, Helpers, Components, behaviors and plugins authors must
mention the version of CakePHP that is compatible with their code.

The mention should be typed in the first line of the introduction for
the subject you written, something like:

This Plugin compatible with Cake 1.2.x

So from the first line and without time losing, the developer who
using Cake 1.3.x will know that plugin is not, directly, suitable for
his application.

Also I think that it is important to add another field in Q & A add
question that lists the version of CakePHP meant by the question if
possible to be as the following: -N/A -CakePHP 1.2.x -CakePHP 1.3.x
-CakePHP 2.0.x -CakePHP 2.1.x
