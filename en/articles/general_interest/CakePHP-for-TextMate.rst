CakePHP for TextMate
====================

by %s on June 11, 2008

Do you like Cake? Are you a TextMate user? Well, then maybe the
CakePHP bundle for TextMate is just what you need!
Many of you TextMate users and CakePHP bakers may already be aware
that once upon a time (until yesterday, actually) there existed a TM
bundle for Cake, but it wasn't that great and it was never updated!

Well, I've taken this chance to refurbish what was there, merge my own
changes and now I introduce to you a newer and quite possibly better
CakePHP bundle for TextMate!

There is currently no release of the bundle, but it is sitting on the
Macromates "review bundles" repository, and waiting for you to check
it out!

You'll need the subversion client to do this. If you don't have SVN,
refer to `http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html`_ on
installing it.

To checkout the bleeding-edge copy of this bundle and use it in your
TextMate, simply copy/paste:

# if this directory doesn't exist, make it with `mkdir -p`
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
$ svn co
`http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Review/Bundles/PHP\`_
Cake.tmbundle

Now all you need to do is run TextMate, open a PHP file and try it
out!
Note: You'll first need to select the "HTML (PHP Cake)" language from
the bottom drop-down list to apply the CakePHP scoping rules to your
files. Setting this one will allow TextMate to remember forever. (.ctp
and .thtml templates are automatically recognized).

That's all! I hope you enjoy the bundle, and if you have any questions
or comments, any kind of feedback at all--do not hesitate to contact
me on IRC (irc.freenode.net/#cakephp) or e-mail.
