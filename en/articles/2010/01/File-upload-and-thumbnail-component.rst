File upload and thumbnail component
===================================

by %s on January 05, 2010

Attachment component for CakePHP handles file uploads to the file
system. If itâ€™s an image file, it creates as many thumbnail copies
as you need.
Iâ€™ve this project from the public copy from sabbour, to have a
standard way of uploading files to CakePHP projects.

It is version controlled at (and you can download the fresher source
code from)
`http://github.com/tute/Thumbnail-component-for-CakePHP`_
Usage

#. [li] Copy attachment.php to /app/controllers/components/ [li] Add
component to your controller: var $components = array('Attachment');
[li] In your upload form:

View Template:
``````````````

::

    
    <?php
    echo $form->create('Model', array('type' => 'file'));
    echo $form->file('Attachment');
    ?>




Filesystem storage (default)
----------------------------

1. In your controller action (save file_path):


Controller Class:
`````````````````

::

    <?php $file_path = $this->Attachment->upload($this->data['Model']['Attachment']);?>

2. In your view, if itâ€™s an image:


View Template:
``````````````

::

    <?php echo $html->image('/attachments/$folderName/{size}/'.$data['Model']['file_path']); ?>



Configuration options
---------------------

* photos_dir: The folder which will hold the files, inside
/app/webroot/attachments/.
* database: Whether to save the images in the database or the
filesystem.
* allow_non_image_files, self descriptive ;-) .
* images_size: Array of different file sizes required by your app.
Each
element is itself an array, like:

::

    'folder_name' => array($width, $height, $do_crop)

You can override the default configuration passing an array of options
while
including the component, like:

Controller Class:
`````````````````

::

    <?php var $components = array('Attachment' => array('photos_dir' => 'pets'));?>

(Check the $config array defined at the first lines of the component
to see
default values and the syntax.)


Methods
-------

upload($data)

* data: file data array from the form. If itâ€™s an image, it calls:

thumbnail($data, $upload_dir, $maxw, $maxh, $crop = false)

* data: the image data array from the form
* upload_dir: the name of the parent folder of the images
* maxw/maxh: maximum width/height for resizing images
* crop: indicates if image must be cropped or not (defaults to false)

delete_files($file-to-delete-name)


Requirements
------------

#. [li] PHP GD library installed and enabled [li] /app/webroot/ must
   be writable by the web server (or you can create
   /app/webroot/attachments/ and make writable that folder). [li] You
   must store in database $file_path returned by
   $this->Attachment->upload in order to reference the file.



To do list
----------

Image resize in upload_DB.
