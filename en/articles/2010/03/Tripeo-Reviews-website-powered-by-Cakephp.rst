Tripeo - Reviews website powered by Cakephp
===========================================

by %s on March 10, 2010

Tripeo is a community for travellers to share their experiences and
reviews for hotels, resorts, and accommodations.
In the summer of '09 we (`http://www.pumpinteractive.ca`_) decided to
build an internal project to build an alternative revenue stream.


Why Cakephp?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MVC approach keeps code organized and cakephp helpers and features
allow to rapidly deploy web applications.



What is Tripeo?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tripeo (`http://www.tripeohotelreviews.com`_) is a community for
travellers to share their experiences and reviews for hotels, resorts,
and accommodations.


Things We Used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cakephp (Obviously)
Facebook Connect
Sluggable Behavior
Meoi Upload Behavior
Cropping Behavior (had to basically recode this)
Open X adserver
Google Maps
Slideshow Pro
Sifr
SQL editor for Mac
Photoshop
Coda For Mac


Planning + Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since their was no client input we streamlined the process:


Wireframes and IA:
``````````````````
We start all projects with wireframes that outline the feature set and
the information architecture.


Database Design:
````````````````
Using a visual database design tool (SQL Editor for Mac) we layout out
the database that reflected the feature set and Cakephp conventions


Bake:
`````
After uploading the SQL to the Mysql database we baked the project
with the command line bake utility.


Visuals:
````````
We designed the core pages in photoshop (Around 8)


Html/CSS/Javascript
```````````````````
We html/css'ed the web comps seperate from the project and fixed cross
browser issues with these standalone html pages. We found this to save
alot of qa and cross browser trouble shooting at the end of the
project.


Development
```````````
We essentially built out the pages ala white label (no graphics or
layout) and skinned the pages after the business logic was completed.


SEO Friendly
````````````
Using the Sluggable behaviour and routing, dynamic page, strategic
internal linking and W3C compliant code we have built a site with
Search being a high priority.


Final Thoughts and Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our next steps are to work on marketing the site and building an
online community for people to share their vacation stories and
nightmares.
