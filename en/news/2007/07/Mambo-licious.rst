Join us in welcoming Mambo to the CakePHP community.
On Saturday, we were pleasantly surprised to receive an email from the
Chad Auld, project lead of Mambo, informing us that CakePHP will form
the core for version 5 of the popular Mambo CMS. As you can read from
their announcement[1] there are several reasons Mambo chose CakePHP,
not the least of which were the clean separation, sensible
conventions, and ability to write more maintainable and extensible
code. We were happy to greet the Mambo team in IRC and we setup a
communication channel to answer any questions they may have as they
make the move to CakePHP.

We are excited that Mambo recognizes and embraces the extensibility of
CakePHP and we are sure they will continue to produce a powerful CMS.
We anticipate some great input from the Mambo team as they build out
version 5, but rest assured our goals for CakePHP will remain the
same.

One of the best parts about this news is the unifying of the
communities. We are sure the dynamic and vibrant CakePHP community
helped Mambo with their decision. We have always felt that the CakePHP
community is one of the best, and now we can add in the members of the
Mambo community. Surely, this will only make life on the google group
and in IRC more fun as more bakers enter the mix.

Happy baking.
