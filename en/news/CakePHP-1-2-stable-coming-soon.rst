CakePHP 1.2 stable coming soon
==============================

by %s on May 13, 2008

The Cake Team is working tirelessly to release the highly anticipated
CakePHP 1.2 stable. Here's your chance to participate in this ground
breaking version of the best and most popular framework for PHP.
The `CakePHP team`_ is gearing up to finally push out a stable 1.2
release! If you are following the `trac timeline`_ you can see that
everybody is putting in huge amounts of work to fix bugs and get
everything stable.

But in order for this to happen we need your help! Here are a couple
things you can help with:


+ Submit patches and test cases: If you know `how to write test
  cases`_, please try to provide test cases and patches for `opened
  bugs`_ that currently have none.
+ Provide information on how to replicate bugs: We spend lots of time
  trying to replicate bugs with little information provided. If you
  experience any of the `listed bugs`_ and are able to replicate them,
  let us know how!
+ Report new bugs: If you know of any bugs currently not listed in
  trac, please `open a new ticket`_ with as much information as
  possible.
+ Help the docs team: The better the docs, the better the framework.
  Help by submitting content to the `CakePHP Book`_.

This is a great opportunity for everybody out there to get actively
involved in open source development and steady contributors will be
considered for the core team.
