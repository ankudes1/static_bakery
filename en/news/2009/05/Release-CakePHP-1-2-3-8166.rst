Release: CakePHP 1.2.3.8166
===========================

by %s on May 04, 2009

I am happy to announce another release of CakePHP 1.2. CakePHP
1.2.3.8166[1] includes several bug fixes and most importantly a
security fix. To understand the security issue please have a look at
Ticket #6336[2]. While this may not affect every installation of Cake,
we do recommend that everyone take the time to upgrade their
applications. Also, note that there was a bug in Paginator related to
changing directions on sorting that is now fixed. For a complete list
of changes, please look at the changelog[3].
I would also like to bring your attention to the work being done on
CakePHP 1.3. You can see we have several branches[4] and many
commits[5] have also been pushed. So, development is pushing forward
nicely, though I still cannot offer up an expected release date.

Happy Baking.
