The cake is still rising
========================

by %s on October 23, 2009

Recent weeks have seen a few changes in the development team, as well
as some clarification of the roadmap for CakePHP future releases. We'd
like to thank those leaving for all their hard work and contributions.
For those sticking around, you're in for a treat!
CakePHP Project Manager Garrett Woodworth and Developer Nate Abele
have left the CakePHP development team. The entire team would like to
thank them for their amazing work and efforts towards the core,
cultivating the community and various other contributions associated
to ongoing CakePHP development. We don't feel that we can fully
express the gratitude we have for all their hard work, so we won't.
Nate and Garret you will both be missed, thanks for all the fish.


Where does that leave us?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recent efforts have seen CakePHP 1.3 being developed primarily by Mark
Story. Mark has taken the lead on this version, and has been steam
rolling bugs and plucking out enhancements for this version.
Phenomenal progress has been made on the 1.3 branch, and we're all
excited to see the progress.

While CakePHP 1.3 is still in development, we're hearing reports of
project cropping up using the 1.3 core with great success. This is a
testament to the rigorous testing regime in place for 1.3 and the
upcoming 2.0 branch of code.

CakePHP 2.0 development has picked up significantly, being led by
Predominant (Graham Weldon) and PhpNut(Larry Masters). A push is being
made to release a "development" release as soon as possible. The rough
roadmap and feature set of the CakePHP 2.0 branch has been updated on
the CakePHP 2.0 wiki[1]. We're all excited to see more user input and
feedback on the CakePHP 2.0 development and plans.

So, while we've had changes in the development team recently, in terms
of the active developers working on CakePHP current branches, very
little has changed. We'd also like to extend a thanks to Matt Curry[2]
for providing a fill-in-the-blanks reply, to all the end of the world
comments floating about.
