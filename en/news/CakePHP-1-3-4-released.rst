containing other keys.

Download the release[2] today, and catch up on the updates by perusing
the changelog[1].

Work on the 2.0 branch is continuing to progress and a few topic
branches have already been merged it. If you are interested in what
the future might contain, you can view the in progress wiki pages[3]
on lighthouse. There is still no estimated time of completion. But
when there is you can find out about it here. The 1.3 temporary wiki
pages will be removed in the next few weeks, as they have not been in
use for quite some time. If you have any links or bookmarks pointing
at them you should update them to the cookbook pages.

A huge thanks to all involved in terms of both contributions through
commits and diffs, as well as those that took the time and effort to
submit tickets, update documentation and otherwise contribute to the
framework.
