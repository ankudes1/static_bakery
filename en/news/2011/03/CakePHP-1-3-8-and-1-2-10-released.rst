CakePHP 1.3.8 and 1.2.10 released

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 1.3.8 and 1.2.10. These releases are bugfix/maintenance
releases for the 1.2 and 1.3 branches. Since the release CakePHP 1.3.7
in January, there have been over 35 commits[1] and 30 tickets
resolved. The 1.2 branch has 20 commits[2] and 15 tickets resolved,
since the release of 1.2.9 in November. There have been a few changes
that may affect your application in each version:


1.3
~~~

+ Boolean handling for Postgres has been improved.
+ Installs using the top level index.php and no url re-writing should
  work better now.
+ DboMysqli no longer incorrectly handles socket and port options.
+ Blackholes caused by defining custom name attributes on fields has
  been fixed.
+ The %e time specifier now works on windows.
+ Cake console properly runs when started in C:\ on windows.
+ Actions starting with their prefix, but lacking a '_' are correctly
  handled now.
+ You can now create submit buttons with no text.



1.2
~~~

+ Paths for virtual machines are now correctly handled.
+ Installs using the top level index.php and no url re-writing should
  work better now.
+ Date headers are now correctly added to emails sent from
  EmailComponent.
+ EmailComponent now registers and un-registers its View instance,
  this allows helpers to access View when rendering email messages.
+ FormHelper::checkbox() now correctly handles checked = false.
+ TextHelper::autoLinkEmails now correctly links email addresses with
  '.'

Development on 2.0 continues to progress well. A few topic branches
have been merged in. Most notably, re-implementation of AuthComponent,
Pagination as a component, and HttpSocket. If you are interested in
what the future might contain, you can view the in progress wiki
pages[3], and open tickets[4] on lighthouse.

A huge thanks to all involved in terms of both contributions through
commits, tickets, documentation edits, and otherwise contribute to the
framework. Without you there would be no CakePHP.
