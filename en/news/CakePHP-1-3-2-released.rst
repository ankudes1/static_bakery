the release of CakePHP 1.3.1[1]. These reports address issues with
caching and Windows support that warranted a faster release than
normal. And so, we are proud to announce the immediate availability of
CakePHP 1.3.2[2]. Thanks to those that reported the issues, and helped
with tracking down the problem.

This release comprises 15 commits and 7 closed tickets. There are no
critical changes that will affect running applications on the 1.3
codebase. A merge of the new version should not present any issues.

Check the changelog[3] for a full set of details regarding changes.

Finally, CakeFest was announced, and is scheduled for early September
2010 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. CakeFest is the official CakePHP
conference, comprising four days of workshops and presentations. For
