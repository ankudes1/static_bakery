introducing something new to chew on
====================================

by %s on November 20, 2008

Chaw is an application designed to help better manage version-
controlled projects. You can read about some of the features in Chaw
on the wiki [url]http://thechaw.com[/url]
As some of you may have noticed, the source for
`http://book.cakephp.org`_ was released on
`http://thechaw.com/cakebook`_. Making the source available is a great
step in improving the documentation efforts of CakePHP. In addition,
the release allows other developers to use the application for the
documentation of their own projects.

So, you may be wondering about `http://thechaw.com`_. This application
was built because I wanted to have more control over the management of
our projects. The ability to add features as we need and ensure that
the code is in a safe place is very important to me. I see the
development of this application as a big step forward in the
development of the CakePHP. With this application, we will begin
rolling out ways to make it easier for developers to collaborate and
share. Stay tuned for more developments. Did someone say plugin
server? Oh, you will have to be at CakeFest #2 -
`http://cakefest.org`_ to hear about that...

The goal behind `http://thechaw.com`_ is quite simple. Provide a
simple interface to consolidate all the CakePHP development in one
place. This goal may raise the question of what will happen to
cakeforge - `http://cakeforge.org`_. The answer is that we hope to
transition the projects on cakeforge to the chaw. This will give us an
opportunity to clean out some of the abandoned projects and moving
forward we will be able to provide a better service.

I truly you hope you all enjoy `http://thechaw.com`_. If you have any
questions or comments stop by #chaw on irc.freenode.net or send a
message to `http://groups.google.com/group/chaw`_
