CakePHP Workshop, Sept 6&7, Raleigh NC USA
==========================================

by %s on July 31, 2008

[p]We are excited to announce the first workshop for CakePHP. We have
worked with Debuggable to come up with a schedule that will cover many
of the features in CakePHP. The schedule is unique in that it also
provides for adhoc sessions alongside the scheduled talks. We will be
happy to see people strolling in and out of every session, sharing
their experiences, and learning in a collaborative and open
environment. [/p] [p] We hope that the sessions provide developers at
all levels an opportunity to experience CakePHP. We expect everyone
who attends the workshop to walk away with a better understanding of
the CakePHP internals and how to maximize the automagic in CakePHP.
[/p]
