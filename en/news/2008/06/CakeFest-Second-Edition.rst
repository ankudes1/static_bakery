CakeFest Second Edition
=======================

by %s on June 26, 2008

Join us at our second conference: CakeFest Second Edition. Attend the
official CakePHP gathering to be celebrated during the first week of
December, 2008.
After the success of our first conference, we've decided it was about
time to host the next CakeFest, the official CakePHP gathering for
everything related to CakePHP. This time we chose to move the
conference away from the USA and host it on an international location.
Destination? Buenos Aires, Argentina. When? First week of December,
2008.

The second edition of CakeFest will offer great talks and workshops,
some of them in English, and some of them in Spanish, so everyone is
invited, including those that are part of our international
communities! We are looking forward to a great event, and we are
certainly looking forward for you to join us!
