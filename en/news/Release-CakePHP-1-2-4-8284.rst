Release: CakePHP 1.2.4.8284
===========================

by %s on August 03, 2009

The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release of two
new versions. Firstly, CakePHP 1.2.4[1] is a bug fix release of the
latest stable branch. Check the changelog[2] for all the changes.
Also, we have made CakePHP 1.3.0-dev[3] available for download.
CakePHP 1.2 includes more than 100 commits along with over 70 fixes.

CakePHP 1.3 dev includes many new enhancements and some optimizations.
The most notable changes include
- compatibility changes have been added for PHP 5.3.
- new Javascript Helper including support for multiple js libraries
- improved bake code generation with better support for plugins and
templates

Checkout the 1.3 changelog[4], 1.3 migration guide[5] and 1.3 hit list
for some more ideas.

As well as these changes to the code, we have some other changes to
the project.

- We completed our move to git and opened up
`http://code.cakephp.org`_, which uses the latest version of 1.3, as
the new home for all developments related to CakePHP. The old
development site at trac.cakephp.org will continue to exist for legacy
purposes, however, you will not be able to create new tickets. If you
have any new issues on 1.2 or find problems with 1.3, please goto
`http://code.cakephp.org/tickets`_.

- With the move to git, you will see lots of branches and might wonder
which ones to use.
- master: latest stable, 1.2.4.8284
- 1.2: development branch for bug fixes
- 1.3: development branch for new features

There are several other branches, but those are for specific feature
development and may not be stable. Feel free to fork the project and
work on code as you need it. We can pull changes in from your fork and
we have actually already done this a few times.

- We have some changes to the CakePHP job board, located at
`http://cakephp.org/jobs`_. We received this message from
EliteOpenSourceJobs.

"We'd like to thank everyone who has posted jobs on or visited our job
board. Â After many months of having our boards up on several
communities (including Cake) and with a great a deal of feedback from
communities, we have decided to make the job board free to post. Â We
think this will be much better for everyone, as there will be more
postings for developers, and will make it even more apparent that
there are real opportunities for those who know Cake.

We hope everyone will visit cakephp.org/jobs frequently in the near
future, as there are more opportunities than ever on the board. Â We
also hope that if you are looking for developers, you will consider
the Cake board first.

You can also support the community by posting a job widget on your
site.Â This will help companies who want to find use Cake find great
developers fast.Â Just sign up at:
`http://eliteopensourcejobs.com/affiliates/register`_ and we'll get
you a snippet right away.Â It takes less than a minute to sign up."
