The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.4.3.

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.4.3. 2.4.3 is a bugfix release for the 2.4 release
branch. A short list of the changes you can expect is:

+ API Documentation improvements.
+ Long headers are no longer wrapped with PHP_EOL when sending email
  with MailTransport. This should solve delivery issues with Qmail, and
  other SMTP transport agents.
+ Model::\_clearCache() has improved performance.
+ Model's now work better with schema's containing numeric column
  names.
+ An exception is now raised when a view block is opened while it is
  already open.
+ SchemaShell no longer uses `schema.php` as the filename when a
  custom name parameter is provided.
+ MKV is a supported content type.
+ CookieComponent writes are now more consistent. Previously writing
  multi-key and single writes were handled very differently. Fixing the
  write consistency makes deletion data saner and results in fewer
  cookies being transmitted.
+ Empty array data in cookies is now parsed correctly.
+ CakeTime::dayAsSQL() now correct supports the timezone parameter.
+ COUNT(DISTINCT x) queries work better in SQLServer now.
+ Postgres sequence values now use custom primary keys.
+ HtmlHelper now correctly encodes URLs generated for meta tags.
+ Using FormHelper::postLink() after creating a GET form now works as
  expected.
+ Model::saveAssociated() handles expression objects correctly now.
+ Model::setSource() does not alter the datasource's cacheSources
  property anymore.
+ Non-breaking spaces are now removed by Inflector::slug()
