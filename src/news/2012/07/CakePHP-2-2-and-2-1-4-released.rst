CakePHP 2.2 and 2.1.4 released
==============================

by %s on July 01, 2012

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of both CakePHP 2.2.0 stable and 2.1.4 which is the final bugfix
release for the 2.1.x branch

The CakePHP team is proud to announce the immediate availability of
CakePHP 2.2.0 stable. As mentioned in previous releases, 2.2 is a API
compatible release with 2.1 and should be generally transparent when
upgrading, except for a few additions you need to make in
configuration files. In addition to this release we have also tagged
version 2.1.4 which would be the last work we do on the 2.1.x series.
Any further stability fixes will be done in 2.2 branch, so we
encourage people to upgrade your apps as soon as possible.

CakePHP 2.2 comes with a great set of new features and goodies, here
is a quick summary of what you can find after upgrading:

+ Dispatcher filters, a lightweight way of attaching callbacks as
  middleware to the dispatcher lifecycle for easier caching or faster
  action responses.
+ New rich api for creating and removing validation rules on the fly
  for models
+ Seamless pagination for custom find types
+ Support for real nested database transactions
+ Cache groups, a nice way for tagging and mass deleting cache entries
  using such tags
+ Improved logging support, several new utility methods were added to
  CakeLog
+ Configure class can now dump stored values into any persistent
  storage
+ AuthComponent now accepts ` contain` as a key for storing extra user
  information in session
+ Several improvements to CakeEmail, such as custom header charset,
  custom themes, setting links domain and custom helpers defined at
  configuration time
+ PUT and DELETE requests encoded with application/x-www-form-
  urlencoded will have its data placed into CakeRequest::$data
+ Set class was deprecated in favor of Hash, a faster and more
  reliable implementation
+ CakeTime is now timezone aware and fully capable of translating
  dates from one zone to the other
+ CakeTime can now also accept DateTime objects in addition to strings
  and timestamps
+ FormHelper now shows more reliably required fields based on
  validation rules
+ HtmlHelper::tableHeaders() now supports setting attributes per table
  cell.
+ Better web tester experience
+ Improved error handling, featuring custom fatal error templates
+ Redis support for caching
+ Added new validation methods for upload checking and natural numbers
