CakePHP 1.2.5 Includes almost 40 commits and more than 20 fixes.
Furthermore, due to popular demand CakePHP 1.2.5 is compatible with
PHP 5.3 and includes fixes to suppress the deprecation messages. See
the changelog[2] for a complete list of changes and bugs fixed.

The 1.3 branch has seen continued progress and there will be another
development release sometime soon. If you would like to contribute to
the development of 1.3 and hasten its arrival, there is a more
detailed summary of things to do[3]

And as always, thank you for helping us make a great framework.
