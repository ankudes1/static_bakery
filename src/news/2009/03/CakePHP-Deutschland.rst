CakeFest Berlin 2009 is coming! Plus many more exciting announcements.
We have some very exciting news for the CakePHP community in Europe.
First, this week we are officially announcing the next CakeFest event,
to be held July 9th through the 12th in Berlin, Germany. As with
previous CakeFests, this event is the premiere gathering of CakePHP
developers, where we'll explore some of the best and brightest new
ideas the core team and community at large have to offer.

However, unlike previous events, we'll also be offering a two-day
CakePHP workshop event before the conference. This event will feature
hands-on training by members of the CakePHP core team, who will walk
you step-by-step through a series of tutorials designed to give
developers, both new and seasoned, a solid understanding of how to
build apps with CakePHP. We'll be covering everything from learning
MVC design best practices through real-world examples, to project
management tips, to performance optimization techniques. If you're new
to CakePHP and looking to quickly boost your skill level, or a veteran
looking for some one-on-one Q, this event is for you, but be sure to
book soon as space is limited.

For those wishing to attend just the conference portion, rest assured
that it'll be worth the trip. In addition to cutting-edge
presentations and a chance to meet and network with other members of
the CakePHP community, there are expected to be some very exciting
announcements about the future of the CakePHP project.

Check out `http://cakefest.org`_ for full details on the event. Also,
if you'd like a chance to win a free conference pass, check out
`http://cakefest.org/pages/badges`_. Just put a badge on your site,
and fill out the contest form. Also, if you have an innovative project
or other interesting topic you'd like to share, you can submit a talk
proposal at `http://cakefest.org/talks/add`_.

In addition to CakeFest, we're also excited to announce the launch of
`http://cakephp.de`_, the official German-language CakePHP portal,
brought to us courtesy of the translation efforts of Christian
Fahrmair of `http://compolis.de`_. Thanks Christian! Cakephp.de joins
several other CakePHP site translations, including `http://cakephp-
fr.org`_ and `http://cakephp.jp`_.

As you may know, the CakePHP Cookbook is already available in whole or
in part in almost two dozen languages, but as the community continues
to expand, these portals will become increasingly important. To
facilitate the growing needs of the international CakePHP community,
we'll be establishing an official translation team. If you're
interested in joining in the effort and seeing CakePHP sites and
content in your native language, you can sign up on the newly-minted
CakePHP translation team mailing list: `http://groups.google.com/group
/cakephp-translators`_.

Finally, we'd like to thank the community for all your support thus
far. Because of your continued participation, the CakePHP project is
stronger than ever, and we hope to thank as many of you as possible in
person in Berlin this summer!
