CakePHP with EZPDO
==================

This article describe the work I have done to integrate EZPDO with
CakePHP.
I started to work few weeks ago, on integrating CakePHP with EZPDO. As
this is the first time I work with PHP, CakePHP and EZPDO, the result
still needs improvement but is however quite satisfying.
