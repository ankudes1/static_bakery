Get the fresh new release of CakePHP
We put together a new bug fix release for 1.1.x.x stable branch, so
download[1] version 1.1.14.4797 Have a look at the change log[2] to
see what has been updated and fixed.

We have also been working hard to get all the features into 1.2.x.x
branch. We are not quite there yet, so we have another 1.2.0.4798alpha
packaged and ready to download[3]. While this release is still an
alpha, most of the core features are stable and running nicely. You
can view the 1.2.x.x change log[4] for recent additions. We are still
working on the new documentation, but there is some good information
already on the Bakery and in some of the blogs about the new features.

If you would like to help out please email docs _at_ cakephp.org or
stop by IRC.
