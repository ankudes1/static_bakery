Sluggable Behavior for easy permalinks
======================================

by vduglued on November 25, 2011

I put together a CakePHP behaviour for generation of permalinks as a
record is saved to the database.

This has been shown to help with search engine optimisation, getting
important keywords and phrases into your site URLs.

+ Specify a source field from which the slug should be generated (e.g.
  column “headline” : ‘The Great & the Good’)
+ Specify a database field into which the slug should be stored (e.g.
  column “slug” : ‘the_great_the_good’)
+ Automatically handle potential duplicates, adding numerical suffixes
  accordingly Keep slugs constant even when source field changes (for
  true permalinks)
+ Slug may be manually overridden without problems by putting it into
  the data array being saved in Cake
