Image Resizer Component for CakePHP2
====================================

by mdunham918 on September 20, 2011

This is a very easy to use image resize component that was built for
cakephp 2. Download the files or follow the progress at

I needed an easy way to resize photos in many controllers, and I
noticed there was no ImageResize component currently out for CakePHP2.
Well, now there is all you do is add 'ImageResizer' to your components
array and bingo your ready to go. Its a very solid code base and does
utilize exceptions for problems like file not found or invalid file
format which can be caught.
