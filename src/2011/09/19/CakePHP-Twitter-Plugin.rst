CakePHP-Twitter-Plugin
======================

by nitsche on September 19, 2011

I have created an easy plugin for CakePHP to use the main methods of
the Twitter API with OAuth.
A few weeks ago I already wrote an `article`_ about a component for
Twitter I've wrote.
Now I have turned this one in a full plugin and fixed some bugs.
So if you would like to use this one visit my GitHub profile under:
`https://github.com/fnitschmann/CakePHP-Twitter-Plugin`_ and have a
look on it. I promise, it's very easy in use.

The **installtion guide** can be found under
`https://github.com/fnitschmann/CakePHP-Twitter-
Plugin/wiki/Installation`_

A full **function reference** of the plugin is also available
on:`https://github.com/fnitschmann/CakePHP-Twitter-Plugin/wiki
/Function-Reference`_

So just have a look on it.
If you have any questions, tipps or something like this. Watch or fork
the repro an GitHub or send me a message/email.
