Following hot on the heels of CakePHP 1.3.0-RC1, the CakePHP
development team is happy to announce the release the CakePHP
1.3.0-RC2. This release marks the halfway point of the release
candidates for 1.3.0. Since 1.3.0RC1 was released 2 weeks ago there
have been over 40 commits and 20 tickets fixed. Our current plan is to
continue a rapid set of Release Candidate releases until 1.3.0 stable
is released.

There have been no major features added since the last Release
Candidate. There have been minor additions to Inflector , DboSource
and Bake tasks related to fixing existing issues. Moving forward we
are not planning on any API changes unless required to fix an issue
with existing features.

In other project news, all of the 1.3 book has new sections every few
days. While not fully complete, the documentation improves each week.
Any help in filling the remaining holes is appreciated. Also give the
code a spin, the more eyes and hands we have on the code the faster we
can get issues resolved.

We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed documentation, tickets
and code between the last release and now.
