CakePHP 1.3-RC1 freshly sliced
==============================

The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
CakePHP 1.3.0-RC1. Since 1.3-beta was released we've been hard at work
implementing new features and fixing issues in existing features in
the 1.3 branch. There have been over 165 commits, and more than 75
tickets resolved.
The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
CakePHP 1.3.0-RC1. Since 1.3-beta was released we've been hard at work
implementing new features and fixing issues in existing features in
the 1.3 branch. There have been over 165 commits, and more than 75
tickets resolved. All methods previously issuing deprecation errors
have since been removed, and will cause fatal errors in non-updated
code.

There have been no major features added since the beta as the codebase
stabilizes. 1.3.0-RC1 is the first of 4 Release candidate releases.
Moving forward, there will be no further enhancements applied to the
1.3 branch and only issues with the existing features will be done. We
are hoping this will afford a rapid series of releases building toward
the 1.3 stable release.

In other project news, all of the 1.3 related wiki pages have been
migrated to the new 1.3 book[1]. During the release candidate process,
we will be focusing on updating the documentation pages as well as
expanding any holes in the API documentation. Your help in these areas
would be greatly appreciated, as the more eyes and brains we have
looking at the documentation the better we can make it. Please edit
the book directly, and submit patches/tickets for the API.

We'd like to thank you the community for the their ongoing support and
contributions. Without the community surrounding CakePHP this project
wouldn't be as vibrant and energetic as it is.
