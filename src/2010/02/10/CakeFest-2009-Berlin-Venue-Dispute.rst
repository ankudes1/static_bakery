CakeFest 2009 Berlin Venue Dispute
==================================

A recent posting by Felix GeisendÃ¶rfer of Debuggable[1] has resulted
in some concerns amongst the CakePHP[2] community after payment
disputes for the venue from CakeFest Berlin 2009. The Cake Software
Foundation[3] would like to assure all developers and users of the
CakePHP framework that the status and direction of the framework
remains unchanged.
The Cake Software Foundation was formed to provide support and keep
the CakePHP project going. The Foundation was intended to be setup as
a 501(c)(3) organization[4], effectively operating as a not-for-profit
entity. This status setup was the responsibility of the previous
President of the Cake Software Foundation, Garrett Woodworth (gwoo);
and was never finalized completely. As a result of the status of the
Cake Software Foundation not being 501(c)(3), various fines were
issued for non-payment of taxes off income earned from monetary
contributions and previous CakeFest events, including CakeFest in
Berlin. This ultimately resulted in the freezing of accounts for the
Cake Software Foundation. After assessment from the treasurer of the
Cake Software Foundation, (Larry Masters), the then President was
requested to resign.

In the months since that resignation, the Cake Software Foundation has
undergone extensive dealings with their lawyers to finalize the
501(c)(3) status of the organization. Throughout this process the team
at Debuggable have been informed of the situation. The Cake Software
Foundation requested that Debuggable assist in arranging an agreement
between the venue and the Cake Software Foundation to remove
Debuggable as a liable party in the CakeFest venue arrangements, and
to allow the remaining amount to be paid in full. Further to this, a
partial payment was made personally by Larry Masters, treasurer of the
Cake Software Foundation. Further requests have been made to have
Debuggable issue invoices for partial payment of 500 Euro per month,
as an alternative should an agreement not be possible with the venue.

As a point of clarification, it should be noted that the Cake Software
Foundation and Cake Development Corporation[5] are completely separate
entities. While both entities share some staff / members, neither
entity has influence or control over the actions of the other.

The Cake Software Foundation does not approve of the public posting of
previously private conversations and arrangements between the
foundation and Debuggable, and will continue ongoing efforts to
rectify the situation with both Debuggable and the venue. The Cake
Software Foundation understands and appreciates the success that
CakeFest can be with local users assisting the organization and setup
of the events; However the foundation will ensure that all future
events are managed internally to avoid such issues.
