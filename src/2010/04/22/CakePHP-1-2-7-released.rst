In addition to all the excitement with CakePHP 1.3's release candidate
run and upcoming release, the development team has been working on
minor updates to CakePHP 1.2. We are pleased to officially announce
the release of CakePHP 1.2.7.

Since the release of CakePHP 1.2.6 in late January 2010, the
development team have closed 36 tickets in 64 commits. This includes a
recent minor security concern within the test suite. For those wishing
to apply just the minor security patch to an existing installation, we
have provided a patch [1] to resolve this issue. This concern is only
present in sites that operate with the debug setting enabled, and does
not affect deployments using a debug setting of zero.

As the team moves forward with CakePHP development, we are focusing on
the upcoming release of CakePHP 1.3 and ongoing development on these
newer versions. Stay tuned to the bakery for announcements regarding
the 1.3 version and more.

Thanks to everyone who submitted tickets, patches and comments since
CakePHP 1.2.6.
