=============================

The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
CakePHP 1.3-beta.
The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
CakePHP 1.3-beta. We've been hard at work implementing new features
and fixing issues in existing features in the 1.3 branch. Since
1.3-alpha there have been more than 600 commits and more than 43
tickets have been closed. A number of new features have been
implemented most notably, Model virtualFields[1], changes to the
plugin and theme assets[2], improvements to TimeHelpers ability to
output i18n friendly formats, and a refactored test suite harness[3].
When upgrading to 1.3-beta it is recommended that you replace
app/webroot/test.php with the one in the repository and check out the
Migration Guide[4] as well as the new features guides [5] for changed
and new features in 1.3.

In other project news, all the previous stable release points for 1.2
have been retagged and are available in github. We've brought on two
new team members in the past few months as well, both ADmad, and
jose_zap have joined the CakePHP team and are helping with all aspects
of the project. Moving forward with 1.3 we are not planning on adding
changes that break backwards compatibility. Any methods currently
generating errors will be removed in the first Release Candidate. It
is important that you listen to the warnings, as they will become
fatal errors in the future.

If you would like to help with the ongoing development of 1.3, you can
do so in a number of ways. Firstly, filing clear and concise tickets
for any issues helps get the issues resolved quickly. Secondly, you
can also contribute by forking the CakePHP project on github and
implementing fixes, tests cases and features on your forks. You can
use pull requests or tickets to notify core team members about your
changes.

Finally, we'd like to thank you the community for the their greatly
increased and ongoing support and contributions. Since our move to
github and lighthouse the volume of community contributions has had a
dramatic increase, and we'd like to thank the many contributors for
their help in improving CakePHP.
