More Info...
------------
This plugin is based on the Cake 1.3 Combinator Article from the
Bakery - http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/st3ph/2010/09/10
/combinator-compress-and-combine-your-js-and-css-files
I've just made it compatible with CakePHP 2.1, and packaged it as a
plugin, including CSSTidy and jsmin.

The plugin is quick and easy to install, and is available (along with
documentation) on GitHub: `https://github.com/joshuapaling/CakePHP-
Combinator-Plugin`_

PLEASE NOTE - this is my first CakePHP plugin, and also my first
public GitHub project. As far as I know the code included is all legit
and open source. Please let me know if not.
