CakeApp with TwitterBootstrap
=============================

CakeApp is a preconfigured app with TwitterBootstrap and Jquery
installed and ready to go.

Twitter Bootstrap appears to be a very successful CSS framework, and I
must agree. There is a js library that you can include which will help
you get TB (Twitter Bootstrap) setup, but I wanted to take it one step
further.

I created "CakeApp" Which is a CakeApp with some niceties already
added in there for you. Including Jquery and a pre-configured TB,
which should have everything as of 4/13/12. Also, the homepage has
been updated to use TB, so you are running right out of the gate.
