ToastyCMS a CMS for people who love bread that is baked twice
=============================================================

by icompuiz on March 28, 2012

I have been building a CMS for personal use. I call it Toasty. It is a
very simple tool with very basic features. It can be found at
https://github.com/icompuiz/ToastyCMS

I didn't follow any real software process so I lack documentation. I
am still working on it but I am looking for some feedback.

I have included some getting started information
`https://github.com/icompuiz/ToastyCMS/blob/master/README`_

It is built on CakePHP 2.0.1.

I am thinking about reimplementing it with cakephp 2.1.1 and using
more of the cakephp conventions like plugins to support extensibility.

So far the current version being used to manage this website
`http://ritglobalunion.com.`_

Tell me what you think.
