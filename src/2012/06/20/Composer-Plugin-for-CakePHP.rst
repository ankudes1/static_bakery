About Composer
--------------

`Composer`_ is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you
to declare the dependent libraries your project needs and it will
install them in your project for you.

With `Packagist`_, you get access to a vast library of reusable PHP
components that will help a lot in your development work.

How to use
----------

#. `Download the plugin`_ and place it at ` APP/Plugin/Composer`. Or
   via Git:

::

    cd APP/Plugin
    git clone git://github.com/uzyn/cakephp-composer.git Composer

#. Load the plugin by adding this line to the bottom of your app's `
   Config/bootstrap.php`:

::

    <?php
    CakePlugin::load('Composer', array('bootstrap' => true));

#. That's all! Composer is ready for use. ` composer.json` is located
   at ` APP/composer.json`. It is automatically created if it is not
   found. Packages are installed to ` APP/Vendor` as per CakePHP
   convention. Invoke Composer from command line with `
   Console/cakecomposer.c`. For example, to install `opauth/opauth`_
   using Composer's ` require` command.

::

    cd APP
    Console/cake composer.c require opauth/opauth:0.*

   To install packages defined at ` composer.json`

::

    Console/cake composer.c install

#. This plugin also makes use of Composer's autoloader. Start using a
   Composer-loaded classes right away without needing ` require()`, `
   include()` or ` App::import()`. For example, to instantiate a new
   Opauth object, simply instantiate Opauth from anywhere (model,
   controller, view, *literally anywhere*) in your CakePHP application:

::

    <?php
    $Opauth = new Opauth();
