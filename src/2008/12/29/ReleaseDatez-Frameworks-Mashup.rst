ReleaseDatez: Frameworks Mashup
===============================

A web application that helps to discover upcoming DVD and Music
releases on Amazon.


Intro
`````
Originally, I had an idea to craw through Netflix to get upcoming DVD
releases but somehow ended up doing Amazon product. The goal of the
site is simple: To focus on a product's release date and to allow
people to discover the undiscovered products.


Site link

`http://www.releasedatez.com/`_


What was used
`````````````
The site was built using triple frameworks: Blueprintcss for CSS,
jQuery for JavaScript, and CakePHP for Server-side language. Since
this is a Cake post, I won't say much about Blueprintcss or jQuery.
All I can say is they are both outstanding frameworks and they both
help me shorten my coding time. Initially, I had some trouble
implementing AJAX using jQuery and Cake but I solved the issue thanks
to the helpful community.


CakePHP Benefits
````````````````
Now to the benefit of CakePHP. This is the first time I've really used
a PHP framework so the learning curve was quite steep for me. But
after I really sat down and built a few model, controllers, and views,
it was a lot of the same thing after that. These are some added
benefits that I got from using Cake:

+ Organization/Manageable code â€“ Code has never been this easy to
  follow.
+ Faster development â€“ It would have taken me twice as long to
  finish ReleaseDatez without Cake.
+ Expandability â€“ It's very easy to expand the functionality of the
  site (e.g. search functions, category filters, etc...)



Great CakePHP Features
``````````````````````
There are some features in the framework that just wowed me. These
are:

+ Pagination â€“ Very easy to implement.
+ Routing â€“ Makes your URL look clean.
+ Console â€“ Organizes my cron script (something this site cannot
  live without).



Overall Experience
``````````````````
CakePHP is a really nice framework to start with because of its rigid
structure. This framework really knocks the MVC concept into my brain.
This makes me more prepared for any future projects that I will
encounter.
