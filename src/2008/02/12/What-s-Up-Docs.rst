What's Up, Docs?
================

by psychic on February 12, 2008

If CakePHP is the best framework out there, why aren't the
documentation efforts up to par? Ever wondered how you can help? Find
out how. Check out CakePHP's newest tool: the Cookbook.
Alright.

Word on the street is that CakePHP's documentation sucks. There: I
said it.

Now, I've been at this for two years. I think we've seen some pretty
big successes - both for CakePHP and it's documentation - but despite
all that, there's a general feeling out in the community about how
horrible the documentation is.

Rather than talk about the possible reasons or excuses why this is the
case, let's talk about solutions.


Solution First
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've wracked our brains as a team, and we've come up with part of the
solution. We've created a new documentation application that will
house the contents of the manual, community contributions,
translations, and comments.

Community, meet Cookbook.

`http://book.cakephp.org`_
Cookbook is a new application, custom made to turn bad vibes about
documentation into freshly baked prose. It's wiki-like, in that you
can log in and suggest a new section, or suggest edits to existing
content.

It's not wiki-like in that it won't suck. We'll be reviewing each
submission for style, accuracy and voice. Everyone, from the
apprentice to master baker, should be able to help out. The novices
among us can point out where weaknesses lie. The pros can roll up
their sleeves and enlighten the masses.

Stop over and give her a look. Please realize that we're still working
out kinks here and there. Feel free to suggest improvements, but I'll
ask you be forgiving when she reveals her beta-ness. If you notice an
issue with the application, log a ticket at
`http://trac.cakephp.org`_.

If you notice an issue with the documentation, make a suggestion via
the 'book.


Solution Next
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, I'd like to close this article via open thread: How can we
improve?

While you're pondering that million-dollar question, I'd ask you keep
the following in mind:


+ Resources are very limited. Aside from the core team, there's only a
  few people I can think of who has consistently contributed to the docs
  effort.
+ Please research the discussions on our Google Group about wikis and
  forums before suggesting either. It's been well visited.
+ Please try to focus on positive critique rather than complaint.
  Let's gather some good ideas we can act on. Seeing the problem isn't
  as good as seeing one and offering a solution.

Hope to hear from you all soon. I hope you realize that the lack of
quality docs isn't a lack of commitment on my part. Let's all work
together to take CakePHP to the next level.

Happy Baking,

John David Anderson
