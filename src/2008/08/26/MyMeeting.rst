MyMeeting
=========

Meeting management system specifically built to fulfill the
requirements of the malaysian public sector.
MyMeeting Version 2 is a complete rebuild using CakePHP of the
MyMeeting system developed by the Open Source Competency Centre (OSCC
- `http://www.oscc.org.my`_). MyMeeting
(`http://mymeeting.oscc.org.my`_) is a system to help manage the
numerous amount of meetings held by the government agencies of
Malaysia.

The code for MyMeeting version 1 was not maintainable and had to be
redone. CakePHP provides all the tools required to rebuild it as
rapidly as possible and produce better quality codes.
