Release: Some RC2 Sweetness
===========================

by gwoo on June 27, 2008

The release of CakePHP 1.2RC2 [1] with several bug fixes and
optimizations brings more speed and stability to the 1.2 series. Check
out the changelog[2] for the modifications that went into this
release. As promised previously deprecated methods were removed and
others received errors to be triggered. We left the findAll,
findCount, etc methods alone but still recommend that you change to
the new find('all'), find('count'), etc syntax. Otherwise, you'll see
that its mostly bug fixes in the changelog, so upgrading should be as
smooth and easy as replacing your "cake"
We should mention that the CakePHP job board, at
`http://cakephp.org/jobs`_ has received a great response. We hope
everyone is able to find their dream job or team member and can enjoy
the coding together with this tasty new Cake. Also, a bunch of people
have begun following us on `http://www.ohloh.net/projects/cakephp`_
where I generally drink a lot of coffee and work on tickets. From time
to time I get overly excited about CakePHP and new releases. Ah, it's
all part of the fun, I hope you enjoy keeping up with the project
stream.

Anyway, we think you will find this release to be a nice improvement,
and would like to remind you about `CakeFest 2 in Argentina`_. Mariano
has been planning a great event for everyone and I can only imagine
that summertime in South America will be a perfect place to share our
stories about Cake.

Happy Baking.
