Hot out of the oven CakePHP 1.3 alpha
=====================================

by markstory on November 03, 2009

The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
alpha build of CakePHP 1.3.
The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
alpha build of CakePHP 1.3. We've been hard at work improving upon the
already great 1.2 and implementing new features to ease development
and increase the flexibility of CakePHP. There have been a number of
changes to existing features and its recommended that you review the
migration guide[1] for changes in existing classes and features. Also
checkout the new features guides[2] for the new features introduced in
1.3. As the 1.3 code branch stabilizes, methods that are currently
deprecated and generating errors will be removed. It is therefore
important to update the necessary methods to their new names.

If you would like to help with the ongoing development of 1.3, you can
do so in a number of ways. Firstly filing clear and concise tickets
for any issues with new or existing code helps get the issues
resolved. You can also contribute by forking the CakePHP project on
code.cakephp.org and implementing features and test cases in your
forks. This speeds up development as cherry picking commits is faster
and easier than applying patches.

The future roadmap places CakePHP 1.3, as a stepping stone towards the
also in development CakePHP 2.0 branch which will feature a mostly
backwards compatible API. The CakePHP 2.0 branch can be found at
`http://code.cakephp.org/cakephp2`_

Finally, we'd like to thank the community for their ongoing support
and contributions in making CakePHP as great as it is.
