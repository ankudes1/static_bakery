PornoShelf - Video Tube Site easily accomplished with CakePHP
=============================================================

I started out building this site with the idea of having a structure
and a way to update and launch sister sites fast, and provide code
updates without breaking the entire thing. I found CakePHP to handle
the job of keeping things structually sound, so I set out to actually
plan out how I'd do this.


The preliminary stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to sort of grasp the concept of using CakePHP for this fresh
application, I needed to understand what was so special about CakePHP.
A lot of people will say that the scaffolding and baking is what makes
cake special, but actually, what is really specially to me is the
great libraries that really save me so much time not having to write
my own. And the best part -- they're reusable! I'm talking about the
auth component, the pagination system, the routing, etc. The inner
workings of Cake that most applications will need.

I found this and more. The next step was getting my head around the
CakePHP conventions, which make a lot of sense and make for the
application development to be pretty easy. Once I had that down, I set
out to build my basic tables for functionality. I made the tables I
needed, laid it out the way I wanted, and Cake connected the dots
perfectly. The basic DB structure -- the data housing, as I say it --
was done. I baked it up and started tweaking the files.


The Big Idea
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This type of site was easily accomplished in regular PHP because it's
a basic site. It's a video site, with comments,
