Localized and Datasources plugin releases 0.2 for CakePHP 1.3
=============================================================

The first officially supported CakePHP plugins (Localized and
Datasources) developed by the community and the core developers have
released their first public release version 0.2.
The continuing development of CakePHP 1.3 recently eventuated in the
export of certain datasources and constantly growing validation rules
into official CakePHP plugins. This export and separation allowed us
to enable the community to contribute on a more active level.

The communities contributions to date includes validations for 22
countries, and the addition of an XMLRPC datasource. There are further
developments underway to include more popular datasources and extend
this extremely useful set of plugins.

Version 0.2 of the localized[1] and datasources[2] plugins are
available for download[3][4] now via Github.

The Localized plugin offers an extensive collection of Validation[7]
rules for a range of countries. These validation rules are backed up
by solid test cases. These localized validation rules allow you to
provide validation checks for data such as phone numbers, post codes,
and other region specific data that you may employ for your CakePHP
App.

The Datasources plugin contains the less popular datasources that were
previously part of the CakePHP core, as well as user contributed
datasources. The book contains a good description of what
datasources[8] are, and how they are used.

Any issued identified with either of the plugins can be reported[5][6]
via the respective LighthouseApp projects for each plugin. We welcome
any and all input for the development and extension of these plugins.
