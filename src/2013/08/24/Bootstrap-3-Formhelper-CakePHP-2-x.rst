Bootstrap 3 Formhelper (CakePHP 2.x)
====================================

A little FormHelper for horizontal Bootstrap3-compatible forms in
CakePHP 2.x.

Hi,

Nothing really big but never the less it might be useful to some
people:

I wrote a little BootstrapFormHelper which will create
Bootstrap3-compatible Forms via the normal FormHelper-Calls. You do
not need to change any views for this.
