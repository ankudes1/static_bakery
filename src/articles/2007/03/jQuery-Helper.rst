jQuery Helper
=============

by thepeg on March 13, 2007

I wrote an helper that allow you to enjoy jQuery library by helping in
script inclusion and plugin management.
I have only wrote an italian documentation yet but code il simply,
comments are in english (bad english... but english!)

Code download and documentation can be found at:
`http://www.consulenza-web.com/cakephp-jquery-helper.dc-28.html`_
I hope someone will give me an english translation!

EDITORS NOTE: Thank you to Marco for putting together this helper. It
would be great to have a detailed englsih explanation in this article.
If you would like to help email, docs [at] cakephp [dot] org.
