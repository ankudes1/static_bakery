SimpleFinance is an easy to use, state-of-the art web application for
your personal needs in accounting. With this piece of software you can
manage your whole money accounts at anytime, anywhere in the world.
I used CakePHP for this web application because its perfect for it.
SimpleFinance mainly has some masterdata like accounts, currencies and
catgories and some data like transactions. CakePHP really helped me a
lot and sped up my development 10 times. It is so easy to
add/edit/delete the simple masterdata like I need in SimpleFinance.

Please check out the homepage and give it a try!
