Javascript Unit Testing with Jasmine
====================================

Unit testing your JavaScript is something that doesn't come easy.
Luckily, I've compiled a dummy project on GitHub.com that will allow
you to unit test your JavaScript from the browser as well as the
command line with results exported to JUnit XML.
