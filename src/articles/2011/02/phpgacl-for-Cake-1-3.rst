phpgacl for Cake 1.3
====================

An alternative ACL package for CakePHP

The PHPGACL project has been around for some times and provides a more
customizable approach to ACL for CakePHP then the built in ACL
functions. In the early cakephp days its was available for version 1.1
but since 1.2 it has not been compatible. We continued to update it in
house for up to cake 1.3 and have released our code here.

In the future I will provide a tutorial on how to install and use it
but the old article should get people started
