The CakePHP Bakery Launches
===========================

by PhpNut on September 21, 2006

This is the place to be. The CakePHP community is always contributing
something, so we figured we should put together a nice place for
everyone to hang out. Its a pretty complete community publishing
system.
The current build can handle multiple categories in a tree, multiple
pages per article, ratings, tags, and user profiles. We plan to slowly
add features, including adding attachments and icons. Attachments will
help manage images, pod-casts, screen-casts, etc.

You can see that some of the styling and detailing needs to be
completed. We are working on making it look better. If you have any
ideas feel free to post a screenshot and add a comment with the link.

Even before we wrote this post, There have been 100 users added and
some great articles and code samples. This community continues to
impress. Thanks for the help.

More to come.
