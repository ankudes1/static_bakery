Article submission and review
=============================

Here we attempt to explain the process of submitting articles and the
process of reviewing the submissions.
We are psyched with the number of submissions that have come in and
just want to let you know a little about the review process. All the
articles submitted go under review by one of the team members. If the
team has a comment on it, they will leave it unpublished and submit an
Author PM in the comments section.

The Articles usually do not get strict scrutiny, but generally there
are a few things that could be simplified or changed. Sometimes, we
may even refer you to other samples that could help you on your quest
for the perfect solution. Other times, we will just publish the
article and let the community have at it. And there may even be times
when we send you back to the drawing board.

The goal of this is to help raise the level of every community member.
Those who submit articles receive the greatest return. Yeah, we know
its like free training for authors, but hey thats what this is all
about. More people having more fun with easier and simpler lives.

There is a lot of information out there on CakePHP. We hope bringing
it to one place will make it easier to learn and extend CakePHP, while
improving the quality of the code and recognition for authors.

Feedback welcomed. Keep an eye on your submissions.
