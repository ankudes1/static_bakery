Testing your apps with the CakePHP Test Suite
=============================================

This tutorial is a simple guide to getting the CakePHP Test Suite up
and going.
I was invited to the CakePHP Test Suite project the other day, so I
thought I write up a much needed tutorial on how to use it.

First use svn to get a copy of the latest trunk:

`https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/testsuite/trunk/1.x.x.x/`_
Then get the SimpleTest library:

`https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/testsuite/vendors/simpletest/`_
While your at it grab the latest release of CakePHP:

`https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/trunk/cake/1.x.x.x/`_

.. _https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/trunk/cake/1.x.x.x/: https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/trunk/cake/1.x.x.x/
.. _https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/testsuite/vendors/simpletest/: https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/testsuite/vendors/simpletest/
.. _https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/testsuite/trunk/1.x.x.x/: https://svn.cakeforge.org/svn/testsuite/trunk/1.x.x.x/
